    'reading': `Exercise with reading must have content more than 300 words. Analyze the lessonTopic, lessonGoal, grammarFocus and additionalInformation to determine the most appropriate text format. Ensure all content matches CEFR level ${englishLevel || 'as specified'}.`,
    'true-false': hasReading
      ? `EXACTLY 10 statements ALL directly based on the reading text from Exercise 1. NO general knowledge questions. Ensure all content matches CEFR level ${englishLevel || 'as specified'}.`
      : `EXACTLY 10 statements based on the lesson topic and general knowledge about it. Ensure all content matches CEFR level ${englishLevel || 'as specified'}.`,

    'fill-in-blanks': `EXACTLY 10 sentences and 10 words in word bank. Ensure all content matches CEFR level ${englishLevel || 'as specified'}.`,

    'error-correction': `EXACTLY 10 sentences with errors. Ensure all content matches CEFR level ${englishLevel || 'as specified'}.`,
    'odd-one-out': `EXACTLY 10 questions with EXACTLY 5 options each. CRITICAL: In each question, 4 words MUST be of the SAME grammatical category (same part of speech: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, gerund, etc.), and 1 word MUST be of a DIFFERENT grammatical category. This grammatical difference is the basis for identifying the odd one out. Examples: 4 verbs + 1 noun ("eat, drink, sleep, food, run" → odd: "food"), 4 adjectives + 1 verb ("happy, sad, beautiful, run, cold" → odd: "run"), 4 nouns + 1 adjective ("table, chair, book, red, pen" → odd: "red"). IMPORTANT: Randomize the position of the odd word within the options array - it should NOT consistently appear in the last or second-to-last position; vary the position across different questions. Use only single vocabulary words. Exclude proper names, city names, and sentences. Ensure all content matches CEFR level ${englishLevel || 'as specified'}.`,
    'synonyms': `EXACTLY 10 word pairs. CRITICAL: SYNONYMS ONLY - each pair must contain words with SIMILAR meanings (e.g., "happy" - "joyful", "big" - "large"). Use "items" array with "term", "definition", "letter" fields. Ensure all content matches CEFR level ${englishLevel || 'as specified'}.`,

    'gap-text': `EXACTLY 10 sentences with "text", "answer", and "verb" fields. Each sentence must have a word in parentheses after the gap for transformation. The "verb" field contains the base form of the verb in parentheses (e.g., "I _____ (go) to school yesterday" with "verb": "go"). Ensure all content matches CEFR level ${englishLevel || 'as specified'}.`,
    'negative-prefixes': `EXACTLY 10 words with "word" and "answer" fields. Use common negative prefixes: un-, in-, im-, dis-, ir-, il-. Ensure all content matches CEFR level ${englishLevel || 'as specified'}.`,
    'categorize': `EXACTLY 16 words to sort into EXACTLY 4 categories. MUST include "items" array with 16 strings AND "categories" array with 4 objects containing "name" and "correct_items" fields. Use only vocabulary units. Excluding propare names, names of cities, grammatical units, sentences. Example structure: "items": ["word1", "word2", ...], "categories": [{"name": "Category1", "correct_items": ["word1", "word2"]}].

    'matching-halves': `EXACTLY 10 sentence halves with "first_half", "second_half", and "id" fields. CRITICAL: Each pair must form a semantically and contextually unique match. Include specific details (concrete numbers, specific names of dishes/places, particular reasons, precise conditions, exact times) in both halves to create clear, logical connections that make the correct pairing obvious through meaning and context, not just grammar. Avoid generic sentence beginnings that could grammatically match multiple endings. Each first_half should have a unique element (e.g., specific food name, number, reason, time) that clearly points to its matching second_half through semantic connection. Vary grammatical structures: use that-clauses, when-clauses, because-clauses, which-clauses, for-phrases, to-infinitives. The exercise should require understanding of meaning and context, not mechanical grammatical matching. Ensure all content matches CEFR level ${englishLevel || 'as specified'}.`,

CRITICAL: Use EXACT structure as basic fill-in-blanks - "sentences" array (each with "text" and "answer" fields) and "word_bank" array containing all 10 answers plus 1-2 distractors. Each sentence MUST have ONE blank. Word bank lists all answers in mixed order. Extract key vocabulary and phrases from audio transcript.
