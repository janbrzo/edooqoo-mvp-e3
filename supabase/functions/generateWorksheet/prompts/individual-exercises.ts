You can find Italian, Chinese, Mexican, Japanese, Greek, Thai, Indian, and many more international cuisines. American-style diners and fast food restaurants are also very popular.\\nMost restaurants in New York have menus that include appetizers, main dishes, and desserts. Appetizers are small dishes that people eat before the main meal, such as soups, salads, or garlic bread. Main dishes are usually bigger and include meat, fish, or vegetarian options, often served with rice, potatoes, or pasta. Desserts like cheesecake, brownies, or ice cream are very common.\\nSome of the most popular types of food in New York include pizza, burgers, sushi, and pasta. People also enjoy trying food from food trucks, especially for lunch. One of the most famous dishes in the United States, and especially in New York, is the New York-style pizza. It's a thin, wide slice of pizza, usually eaten with your hands.\\nOf course, not every restaurant visit is perfect. Some common complaints that people make in New York restaurants include:\\n\\"The food is cold.\\"\\n\\"This is not what I ordered.\\"\\n\\"The portion is too small.\\"\\n\\"I waited too long for my food.\\"\\n\\"The bill is incorrect.\\"\\nLearning how to order food and make polite complaints in English is very useful if you ever visit New York or work in customer service.",
